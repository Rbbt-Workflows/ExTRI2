34385058:7:HMGB1:SYP	We found that HMGB1-NLRP3 pathway was activated in the hippocampus of mice offspring by gestational exposure to PM2.5 in a dose-dependent manner, with protein levels of HMGB1, NLRP3, and cleaved caspase-1 as approximately three times as high as those of control. And down-regulating [TF] during pregnancy could alleviate the resultant impairment on learning and working memory as well as hippocampal neurons, up-regulate the synapse related proteins of [TG] and PSD-95 and correct the increased expression of 5-HT2A to comparable levels to control, as well as inhibiting the activation of microglia and decreasing the expression of HMGB1 and Iba1/HMGB1 double positive cells in the hippocampus of mice offspring.

28176369:7:AP-1:cyclin D1	Zymographic and electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that morin suppressed the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) via repression of the binding activity of AP-1, Sp-1, and NF-kappaB. Collectively, these results demonstrate that morin reduced [TG], cyclin E, CDK2 and CDK4 expression via the induction of p21WAF1 expression, increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation and decreased JNK, and AKT phosphorylation, and prevented MMP-9 expression via the inhibition of transcription factors [TF], Sp-1, and NF-kappaB, thereby resulting in the inhibition of growth, migration, and invasion of bladder cancer EJ cells.
