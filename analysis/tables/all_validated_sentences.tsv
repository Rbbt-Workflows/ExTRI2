Two copies of prolactin promoter Pit-1 binding site 1P conferred upon a heterologous metallothionein promoter a response to Q209L-alpha q, implying an involvement of this site in the transcriptional action of Q209L-alpha q on the prolactin promoter.

As published data mention [TF] recognition of [TG] regulating sequences, we verified that this sequence specific binding was also alleviated by 5-hmC. ZBTB2 being considered as a multifunctional cell proliferation activator, notably through p21 repression, this work points out new epigenetic processes potentially involved in carcinogenesis.
