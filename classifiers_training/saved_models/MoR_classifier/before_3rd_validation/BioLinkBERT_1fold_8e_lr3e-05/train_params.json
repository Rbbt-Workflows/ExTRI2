                "[TF] increased the transcriptional activity of the Sox2 gene, and Sox2 increased the transcriptional activity of the [TG] gene, which was reduced by cotransfecion of Cdx2 together with Sox2 in the human gastric carcinoma cell line AGS.",
                "Moreover, we found that [TF] and Sp1 can synergistically enhance the activity of the proximal [TG] promoter.",
                "[TG] repression (in G0) was associated with upstream stimulatory factor-1 (USF-1) occupancy of two consensus E box motifs (5'-CACGTG-3') at the PE1 and [TF] domains in the PF1 region (nucleotides -794 to -532) of the PAI-1 promoter.",
                "Besides known [TF]-regulated genes such as albumin and [TG] genes, the genes newly identified as the HNF-3alpha-regulated ones include three encoding CDP-diacylglycerol-inositol 3-phosphatidyltransferase, phosphatidylserine decarboxylase, and phospholipase A2, which are located en suite in the lipid metabolic pathway in liver.",
                "We found binding of -catenin to the [TG] promoter at [TF] response elements.",
                "We present evidence demonstrating that the Wnt inhibitor and beta-catenin/T-cell factor ([TF])-responsive gene DICKKOPF-1 ([TG]) is a transcriptional target of EWS/FLI1, which can inhibit both basal and beta-catenin-induced transactivation of the DKK-1 promoter.",
                "Similarly, [TF] repressed expression of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporters driven by the ISREs of the 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase, guanylate-binding protein, and [TG] genes in IFN-treated cells.",
                "We tested the role of [TF]-NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) on [TG] gene expression using a JNK specific inhibitor, SP600125.",
                "[TG] is the target gene for [TF]-23b as the miR repressed uPA expression and interacted with the 3'-untranslated region of uPA mRNA.",
                "Ecotopic expression of [TF] related factors showed that Nrf2, but not Nrf1, Nrf3, or Bach1, activated [TG] promoter in a dose-dependent manner.",
                "Taken together, these findings clearly show that IL1B up-regulates the expression of [TG] in endometrial stromal cells in vitro and acts via [TF].",
                "Hair cell death occurred through an apoptotic pathway through activation of caspase-3 and may involve transcriptional down-regulation of the [TG] gene, an anti-apoptotic [TF] target.",
                "Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that [TF] dissociates from the [TG] P2 promoter following the binding of Tax and HDAC1.",
                "Using in vitro assays, we determined that neither IRF-1 nor [TF] is involved in the activation of the [TG] promoter.",
                "In the current study, we examined the role of redox-sensitive transcription factors, [TF] and AP-1 signaling pathways in the modulation of [TG] by heavy metals.",
                "Therefore, we propose that [TF] could be one of the links between inflammation, oxidative stress, and [TG] regulation in these diseases.",
                "TNFalpha treatment was used to test the role of [TF] activation in [TG] expression in a cardiac cell line.",
                "Collectively, the results of the series of experiments indicate that magnolol inhibits [TG] gene expression by blocking NF-B/[TF] and p38 kinase signaling.",

                "Release of TAF7 from [TF] by TAF1 phosphorylation of TAF7 increased TAF1 HAT activity and elevated histone H3 acetylation levels at the [TG] and cyclin A promoters.",
