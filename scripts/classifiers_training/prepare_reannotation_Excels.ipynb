suppresses [TG] promoter activity through interfering with Sp1 activation.', 'The present observations suggest that [TG] auto-regulates its own promoter by competing with Sp1 and that both AP1 and [TF] modulate expression of this gene.', 'Absence of the cooperation of HNF-1beta mutants with [TF] in the human [TG] gene promoter might be one cause of defective insulin secretion.', 'We identified that both HNF1 and [TF] function as transcriptional activators in [TG] gene expression.', '[TF] DN also blocked IL-10-mediated inhibition of MHC class II and [TG] expression.', 'Several genes co-targeted by [TF] and NR1D1 were identified that include: Nr2c1, Recoverin, Rgr, Rarres2, Pde8a, and [TG].', 'Overexpression of [TF] protein with an alanine mutation at Thr-453 or Thr-739 suppressed CO-induced Sp1 binding to the [TG] promoter and its transcriptional activation.', 'Coimmunoprecipitation experiments suggest a role for p300 in [TF] acetylation and [TG] expression.', 'Upon stimulation with androgen in AR-positive stromal cells, E2F1 is displaced from the binding site by AR and replaced with [TF], leading to the recruitment of the silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT)/histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) corepressor complex and repression of [TG] at the chromatin level.', 'Together, our results suggested that [TF] may mediate muscle development through its target genes, [TG], Ndufa6 and Ccne1.', 'Taken together, our data demonstrate that PMA induces [TG] gene transcription through an induction of [TF] in THP-1 cells, thus providing new evidence that the flt-1 gene is a direct target of Egr-1, the transcription factor primarily induced on macrophage differentiation.', 'Nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member1 ([TF]), an orphan nuclear receptor, is involved in the transcriptional regulation of thecal cell androgen biosynthesis and paracrine factor [TG] (INSL3) expression.', 'In the present study, we explore the impact of [TF] on expression of [TG], a gene that is specifically expressed in differentiated keratinocytes.', 'Here, we show that [TF] abolished mRNA induction of [TG] expression, and concomitantly altered the neurotrophin response in a differentiating neuroblastoma cell line.', 'In summary, this study shows that glucocorticoid enhances monoamine oxidase A gene expression by 1) regulation of R1 translocation; 2) direct interaction of the glucocorticoid receptor with the third glucocorticoid/androgen response element; and 3) indirect interaction of [TF] with the Sp1 or R1 transcription factor on Sp1-binding sites of the [TG] promoter.', 'Our studies show that 1,25(OH)2D3-induced transactivation is a dynamic process that involves promoter-specific localization of [TF] and RXR, recruitment of histone acetyltransferase complexes, and in the case of the [TG] gene, modification of histone 4.', 'We show that amlodipine-dependent activation of p21([TG]/Cip1) involves the action of the glucocorticoid receptor ([TF]) and C/EBP-alpha.', '[TF] is a transcriptional regulator of [TG] expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.', 'Subsequently, JAB1 knockdown significantly decreased the expression levels of MDR1, NANOG, and [TG], which are [TF] target genes.', 'The TG2/[TF](NF-B) complex binds to the [TG] promoter and induced its transcriptional regulation.', 'In transient co-transfection, [TF] and AhR gene products demonstrated cooperation in transactivation of the c-myc promoter, which was dependent on the NF-kappaB elements, and in induction of endogenous [TG] protein levels.', '[TF] regulates the expression of [TG] in RAW264.7 macrophages.', \"Transient transfection studies with a series of 5'-deleted [TG] promoter constructs showed that the proximal 964-base region, which contains [TF], SP1, and CRE enhancer elements, is required for activation of the cyclin D1 promoter by PKC-alpha.\", 'Treatment with antisense oligonucleotides against hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha ([TF]) led to the downregulation of steady-state levels of [TG] mRNA under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions.', 'The role of the trans-acting factor [TF] in activating [TG] gene expression was confirmed by transient co-transfection of an HNF-1 alpha expression plasmid and the CYP2E1 promoter fused to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter gene.', 'We conclude that [TF] binding is important for [TG] promoter activity.', \"Analysis of three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) mapping in the [TG] 5'-regulatory region using a luciferase reporter system showed that SNP rs12072037, in linkage disequilibrium with the MYCL1-EcoRI polymorphism and polymorphic in Asians but not in Caucasians, modulated transcriptional activity of the MFSD2A promoter in cell lines expressing [TF] and ARNT transcription factors, which potentially bind to the SNP site.\", 'Here we aimed to further clarify the role of [TF] and the canonical CRE-binding proteins of the CRE-binding protein/activating transcription factor (CREB/ATF) family in the inhibition of [TG] gene expression by TNFalpha in the juxtaglomerular cell line As4.1.', 'In addition, expression level of [TG] mRNA was up-regulated by the silencing of [TF]/EF1 transcriptional repressor which was a down-stream target gene of TGF- and an inducer of EMT.', '[TF], but not its mutants, in combination with ETS-1 and CBFb, or FLI-1, synergistically activated the [TG] promoter.'], '...']\n",
